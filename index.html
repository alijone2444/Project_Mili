                    <p>I need to apologize for saying you "crazy stuff" as if you were a man. I shouldn't have said that. I'm so sorry. Everyone doesn't process things the same way—I should have been nicer to you. I'm sorry for that and sorry to see you in this condition.</p>
                    <p>I know I dragged you into this 'haram' relationship and then didn't know how to protect you from the exhaustion of it. I take full responsibility for the scars. Being sensitive is not a bad thing—I know that now, but it's too late. I'm so sorry I hurt you badly.</p>
                    <p>When you asked for space and mental peace, I kept pushing and arguing instead of understanding. I was more concerned about "what will happen to us" than your actual mental health—your eye issues, your sleep problems, your nausea. I'm sorry I didn't prioritize your well-being when you needed it most.</p>

                    <p>You weren't 'too sensitive' or 'too emotional'—you were just human, and I should have been nicer. I'm sorry for making you feel like you were the problem.</p>
                    <p>During arguments, I became defensive and kept trying to win instead of understanding your feelings. I should have listened when you asked for time and space. Instead, I kept pushing and making things worse. That was my fault, not yours.</p>

                    <p>You weren't 'too sensitive' or 'too emotional.' You were just asking to be heard. I'm sorry for making you feel like you were the problem.</p>
                    <p>There is no problem in you, Maleeha. You are a nice person who deserved better. When you kept thinking "masla mery mein ho" (what if the problem is in me)—that fear was unfounded. The problem was never in you. It was my inability to understand, to give you space, to prioritize your mental health over my own fears.</p>
                    <p>You were right to need space. You were right to protect your peace. I'm sorry I made you feel guilty for doing what you needed to survive. Your sensitivity is not a weakness—it's what makes you beautifully human. You deserved gentleness and understanding, not harsh words during arguments.</p>
